<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>Last updated: April 27, 2023</p>
<p>This privacy policy ("Policy") describes how **anon** ("App"), a Flutter application developed by Prathamesh Anwekar, collects, uses, and discloses your information.</p>

<h2>Information Collected</h2>

<p>The App does not collect any personal information about you. However, to provide core functionalities such as navigation, the App temporarily stores browsing data in memory on your device:</p>

<ol>
  <li>URLs Visited: The App stores the URLs of webpages you visit to enable features like back and forward navigation. This data is stored locally on your device and is not transmitted to us.</li>
  <li>The URL data mentioned above is used solely to provide the browsing experience within the App and is not used for any other purpose.</li>
  <li>The App only allows you to view cookies. It does not modify cookies, and other local data stored by websites, by itself.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Third-Party Services</h2>

<p>The App does not integrate with any third-party services that collect user data.</p>

<h2>JavaScript</h2>

<p>The App offers a toggle button to enable or disable JavaScript on webpages. This functionality does not involve collecting or transmitting any user information.</p>

<h2>Viewing Source Code and Running JavaScript</h2>

<p>The App allows you to view the source code of webpages and run JavaScript code within a console. These features do not involve collecting or transmitting user data. They interact directly with the webpage you are viewing.</p>
<p>The publishers of the App are not responsible for any of the user's interactions with any website via the console.</p>

<h2>Cookies and Local Storage</h2>

<p>The App provides options to view cookies stored by the website you visit and to clear local storage data. This functionality is performed entirely on your device, may not work as intended every time, and does not involve sending any data to us.</p>
<p>This feature simply shows the objects returned by the "document.cookie" property of a website.</p>

<h2>Children's Privacy</h2>

<p>We do not knowingly collect information from children under the age of 13. If you are a parent or guardian and you believe your child has provided us with information, please contact us. We will take steps to remove such information from our servers.</p>

<h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>

<p>We may update this Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Policy on this page.</p>

<h2>Contact Us</h2>

<p>If you have any questions about this Policy, please contact us at prathameshanwekar@gmail.com.</p>
